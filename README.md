# Automatic Door
 # background 
The arena of the competition is simple. Two line folllowing bots race with each other and the one completing the arena first wins. But, at the end of arena there ia a door. The door opens after 5 seconds after it detects the bot and closes after another 5 seconds. So the bot has to wait for their respective door to open and has to cross the door within 5 seconds after it opens. So, our goal is to control the detection of two bots, holding time, and closing and opeaning of two doors which are independent of each other using a single Arduino board.
